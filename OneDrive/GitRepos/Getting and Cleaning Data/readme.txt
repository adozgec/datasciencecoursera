==================================================================

In this assingment I have I will analyze the data supplied with the 
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones study. And then create
a file called run_analysis.r and write a code to answer the
questions.

More information can be found about the study in the fallowing links.

The project data
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


==================================================================

Ther are 5 questions. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
   for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
   set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy
   data set with the average of each variable for each activity and
   each subject.
======================================
The files created for this assigment are 
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'codebook.txt': a guide about each data file created by R

- 'run_analysis.R': file that contains R code which generate the data files.

- 'features.txt': data file containing binded features data. (Since this file is huge it was not uploaded)

- 'sets.txt' data file containing merged binded sets data. (Since this file is huge it was not uploaded)

- 'sets_mean.txt' data file contains mean of every measurement 

- 'features_mean_std.txt' : data file containing binded features data only for mean and std variables (Since this file is huge it was not uploaded)


Notes: 
======
- please look in 'run_analysis.R' file for more information.
